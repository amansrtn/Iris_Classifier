The Iris Classifier is a machine learning model built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify iris flowers based on the length of their sepal and petals. The iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, consisting of measurements of iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
